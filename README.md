This is a simple console demonstration on how to use GraphServiceClient to retrieve the users' mailbox usage.

Note that this code assumes that you have already set up and registered an Azure AD app with the necessary permissions to access the Graph API, and have obtained the Client ID, Tenant ID, and Client Secret.
Also, I have referenced this project to Graph 4.46.0 in order to use DelegateAuthenticationProvider().

Cheers!
